### Solid Principles


Solid Principles are the design principles that enable us manage most of the software design problems.The principles are a subset of
many principles promoted by **Robert C. Martin** . The SOLID acronym was first introduced by **Michael Feathers**. 


* **S : Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**</br>
The principle suggests that the “class should be having one and only one responsibility”.</br>

* **O : Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**</br>
This principle suggests that “classes should be open for extension but closed for modification”.</br>

* **L : Liskov’s Substitution Principle (LSP)**</br>
This principle suggests that “parent classes should be easily substituted with their child classes without blowing up the application”.</br>

* **I : Interface Segregation Principle(ISP)**</br>
This principle suggests that “many client specific interfaces are better than one general interface”.</br>

* **D : Dependency Inversion Principle(DIP)**</br>
This principle suggests that “classes should depend on abstraction but not on concretion”.</br>

#### Why SOLID Principles ? and If we don't follow SOLID Principles we:</br>

* End up with tight or strong coupling of the code with many other modules/applications
* Tight coupling causes time to implement any new requirement, features or any bug fixes and some time it creates unknown issues
* End up with a code which is not testable
* End up with duplication of code
* End up creating new bugs by fixing another bug
* End up with many unknown issues in the application development cycle


#### Following SOLID Principles helps us to:</br>

* Achieve reduction in complexity of code
* Increase readability, extensibility and maintenance
* Reduce error and implement reusability 
* Achieve better testability
* Reduce tight coupling
